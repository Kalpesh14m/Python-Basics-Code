# """"'print()' is a built-in Python function that will output some text to the console.
#
# Looking at the code about cars in the garage, can you guess what will happen?
# You probably have a general idea.
# For each_car in the garage, we're going to do something.
# What are we doing? We are printing each car.
#
# Since "printing" outputs some text to the "console,"
# you can probably figure out that the console will say something like "Ferrari, Honda, Porsche, Toyota."

#""" 'Modules' are pre-written Python code that you "import" in your Python program."""

#"""The phrase "wrapper" means that someone has placed, like a wrapper, Python code over another language.
#So, when you have a Python wrapper around C++ code, what someone has done is written some Python code that interacts with the C++ language."""

#"""Thus, Python can be used to make games, do data analysis, control robot and hardware, create GUIs, or even to create websites."""
