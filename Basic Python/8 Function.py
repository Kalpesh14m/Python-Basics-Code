# The idea of a function is to assign a set of code, and possibly variables, known as parameters, to a single bit of text.
# You can think of it a lot like why you choose to write and save a program, rather than writing out the entire program every time you want to execute it.
#
# To begin a function, the keyword 'def' is used to notify python of the impending function definition, which is what def stands for.
# From there, you type out the name you want to call your function.
# It is important to choose a unique name, and also one that wont conflict with any other functions you might be using.
# For example, you wouldn't want to go calling your function print.

def example():
    print('this code will run')
    z = 3 + 9
    print(z)
